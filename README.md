## General Overview of the Project

The **Predicting Air Quality: An Applied AI Approach to Beijing's Pollution Data** is a machine learning-based project aimed at predicting air quality health index in Beijing using data on pollutants and weather variables. The project focuses on developing accurate models that can forecast air quality  and air quality health index over time, helping stakeholders such as policymakers, public health authorities, and environmental researchers make informed decisions to mitigate air pollution's harmful effects on human health and the environment.

Beijing faces significant air quality challenges, especially during certain seasons when pollutants like PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 can reach hazardous levels. With the help of machine learning models, we aim to create predictive tools that can:
- Provide early warnings on air quality trends.
- Assist in making evidence-based decisions regarding urban planning and public health interventions.
- Support research efforts focused on pollution control and environmental sustainability.

### Project Map
1. **Data Collection:** Data is sourced from Beijing's Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center and China Meteorological Administration. This includes hourly measurements of pollutant concentrations and weather variables like temperature, humidity, and wind direction. The dataset would be found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sid321axn/beijing-multisite-airquality-data-set. It has also been uploaded in the Dataset folder.
2. **Feature Engineering:** The data is processed to extract features that capture temporal patterns in air quality and meteorological conditions. These features are designed to enhance the model's ability to predict AQHI accurately by considering both historical data and seasonal trends. Key features include:
  - **Pollutant Concentrations:** Levels of pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, SO2, and O3.
  - **Weather Variables:** Meteorological data, including temperature, pressure, wind speed and direction, and humidity.
  - **Temporal Features:** Variables representing the time of day, day of the week, and seasonal patterns that influence air quality.
  - **Lag Features:** Past values of pollutants and weather variables (e.g., pollutant levels from the previous hour) to capture time-dependent trends and dependencies.
  - **Rolling Features:** Moving averages or rolling window statistics (e.g., 3-hour or 24-hour rolling mean) to smooth out fluctuations and highlight broader trends in air quality.
  - **New Features:** Additional features, such as the interaction between weather variables and pollutants like AQI (air quality index) that provide deeper insights into pollution patterns. Also features like weekends, hoildays and seasons which help in understanding the pattrens.

4. **Model Training:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and various models are trained to predict future air quality. Advanced models like deep neural networks (DNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) are considered for their ability to capture complex time-series dependencies.
5. **Evaluation:** The model’s accuracy is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared to determine how well the model predicts future pollution levels.

### Expected Outcomes
- **Short-term Predictions:** The model will provide reliable short-term (1-24 hour) predictions of air quality health index in Beijing.
- **Health Impact Forecasts:** The predictions can be used to assess health risks, such as respiratory issues and cardiovascular diseases, that are exacerbated by poor air quality.
- **Urban Policy Support:** The model will help inform public health policies, such as issuing air quality advisories, optimizing traffic patterns, and identifying areas requiring pollution mitigation measures.
- **Sustainability and Environmental Management:** The project will support efforts to reduce pollution and improve the quality of life for Beijing residents by providing data-driven insights into pollution control and environmental policies.

### Map of Stakeholders
- **Public Health Authorities**: Use air quality forecasts to warn the public and healthcare providers of health risks.
- **Government Officials**: Use predictions to enforce regulations and optimize urban planning for cleaner air.
- **Environmental NGOs**: Rely on predictions for advocacy and policy change.
- **Residents**: Receive early warnings about pollution levels and their health risks.
- **Researchers**: Access data for further studies on pollution trends, environmental sustainability, and health impacts.

The overall goal is to create a robust and scalable prediction model that can enhance Beijing's air quality management efforts, reduce health-related costs, and improve the city’s livability.
