# 1. Workflow Map 

This diagram illustrates the end-to-end process for building the predictive air quality model. It starts with collecting weather and pollution data, followed by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to compare trends across timeframes and locations. Feature engineering enhances the dataset by encoding categorical variables and adding relevant features. The data is then split into training and testing sets for building machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.). Predictions for the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) are evaluated for accuracy, completing the process.

# 2. Achieved Goals

The figre above highlights the key objectives of the project that we achieved at the end. It focuses on analyzing seasonal and daily pollution patterns, identifying weather factors linked to pollution, and mapping hotspots in Beijing. A predictive model using weather forecasts is developed to provide timely public advisories. The findings inform actionable policy recommendations, such as adjusting traffic regulations or promoting green initiatives, aligning with broader goals of improving urban air quality and public health outcomes.

# 3. Model Deployment

This figure presents the deployment phase of the project. It begins with data collection from various sources (e.g., satellite, weather stations, and sensors). The processed data feeds into a machine learning model, which generates air quality predictions. These outputs are used for policymaking, urban planning, and health awareness campaigns. Benefits include improved decision-making, community advocacy, and mitigation of health impacts caused by air pollution, as detailed in the end-user benefits section.
